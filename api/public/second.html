          <h1 class="post-title">Ghent, Belgiumm</h1>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>"In the 16th century, Ghent lost it all on the wrong bet. Built around rivers and canals, it was Europe’s second-largest urban centre, falling just behind Paris. When Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who ruled over Belgium, raised taxes to fund military action abroad, the city refused to pay out. They’d already given a fair share, locals argued, and surely Charles, who had been born in Ghent, wouldn’t turn on his home. In response, he marched into the city with his army, stripping it of its finery and parading its leaders in their undershirts, nooses around their necks.</p>
            <p>Today, you can find evidence of the city’s illustrious past in its historical centre, home to a UNESCO-listed belfry and the Gravensteen, a stone fortress said to have been inspired by Crusader castles. And while its heyday is now behind it, Ghentians proudly tell the story of their fall from grace as proof of their rebellious streak. </p>
            <p>This spirit survived, the sign of a place that’s at ease with its identity: socially conscious and full of fresh ideas. Initiatives like Nucleo are repurposing empty spaces into artists’ studios, and inviting the public to peer in once a year — in 2024, the open day is on 5 May. Meanwhile, chefs are experimenting with the earth’s pantry, casting Ghent as a European vegetarian capital. This energy is partly due to it being Flanders’ biggest university city: out of some 267,000 residents, over a quarter are students. This ensures a near endless supply of speciality-roast coffee in the Overpoort student district, and nightlife ranging from candle-lit wine bars to sweaty warehouses, reverberating with the kind of techno more often associated with Berlin. </p>

            <p>The city was named 2024 European Youth Capital by the European Youth Forum — and it’s no surprise. In April, it will celebrate the accolade as part of the biennial Ghent International Festival, which will feature opera as well as dancers on roller-skates. Events will continue throughout the year, with locals as young as 15 invited to contribute ideas. As for what they’ll come up with, all bets are off."
